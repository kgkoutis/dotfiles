# A simple .dotfiles collection (work still in progress)

## Things You Should Install

* Git (2.0+ recommended)
* [Zsh Shell](https://www.zsh.org)
* VIM (8.0+ recommended)

(All of these things are available on [Homebrew](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Homebrew/), btw. ) 

In the `utilities` you may find more interesting stuff like:
1. The `.z` script, check [here](https://github.com/rupa/z.git)
2. The `.boom` configurations, check [here](https://github.com/holman/boom)
3. The `Brewfile` for the `brew` installations

   To produce it you simply run:
   ```bash
   brew bundle dump
   ```
   while to install you run
   ```bash
   brew bundle 
   ```
